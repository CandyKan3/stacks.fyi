## Running the app
Make sure you have Node version 13 or above. Use [Nodist](https://github.com/nullivex/nodist) or [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to change Node version.

Ensure you have all dependencies installed. Run `yarn` in the backend, frontend, and root folders.

Then run `yarn dev` to start the backend and frontend. The frontend is on port 3000 and the backend is on 30001.
