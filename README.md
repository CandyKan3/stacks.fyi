## Running the app
Make sure you have Node version 13 or above. Use [Nodist](https://github.com/nullivex/nodist) or [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to change Node version. Be sure to also have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/). On some versions of Windows you may need [Docker toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/). Follow the instructions in the .env_example file in the backend folder to create a .env.

Ensure you have all dependencies installed. Run `yarn` at the root level.

Then run `yarn dev` to start the backend and frontend. The frontend is on port 3000 and the backend is on 3001.
